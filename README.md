# YouTube trending video scraper
**This is a quick update version, therefore incomplete files are present in this reopsitory.**

This repo contains:
- output file -> storing some files that I scraped from https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=contentDetails,statistics,snippet,paidProductPlacementDetails&chart=mostPopular&regionCode=IN&maxResults=50&key=AIzaSyAaHjUZfRMNZqErxOwyADOOGJ2WvOTC7FE
- modified_scraper.py -> Added 'contentDetails' and 'paidProductPlacementDetails' tags, scraped video duration, definition (HD, 2K, 4K,...), and products placement (does the video have promoted products?)
- The rest -> for testing:) so you can ignore the notebooks. Those are purely for testing, not visualization of anykind. 
(also the json file should be ignored)
